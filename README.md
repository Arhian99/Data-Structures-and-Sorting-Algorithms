# Data-Structures-and-Sorting-Algorithms
Class Projects: Implementation of various user-defined data structures and sorting algorithms in java.

Assignment 1: Reads data from external .txt file and uses data to create instances of LinkedList, HashSet and HashMap. Uses recursive method to mutate linkedList elements into uppercase.

Assignment 2: User-defined implementations of Array, ArrayList, LinkedList, and Queue. As well as, implementation of various sorting algorithms including InsertionSort, BubbleSort, MergeSort, and QuickSort. 

Assignment 3: User-defined implementations of Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, HashSet, HashMap, UnweightedGraph, and WeightedGraph. Reads data from .txt file, tokenizes the data and uses it to instantiate the above data structures. 

NOTE: appologize for capital method names and unconvetional names of things, it was part of the assignment instructions.
